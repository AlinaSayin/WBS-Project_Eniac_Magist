# WBS-Project_Eniac_Magist

This Project:
I did this projekt during my time as a data science student in the wbs school.
In this project I did use SQL/MYSQL, Tableau and MS Powerpoint.
The scenario: 
The compnay I'm working for is Eniac. 
Enaic want to expand into the brazilin market with the help of the company magist.
My goal was to confirm that the company magist met the requirements, so that Eniac could work with magist.
To do that I did use SQL/MYSQL and did some query to answer some business questions.
After that I did some charts with Tableau & put it my results in a rounded MS PP.
